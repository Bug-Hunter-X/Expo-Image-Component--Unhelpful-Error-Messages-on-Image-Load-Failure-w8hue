This error occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that's improperly formatted or points to a resource that doesn't exist.  It might also happen if the network request to fetch the image fails due to network issues or incorrect permissions. The error message itself isn't always very descriptive, often just showing a generic error or no message at all.  Debugging can involve inspecting the URI, checking network connectivity, and ensuring the image source is accessible. Example:
```javascript
<Image
source={{ uri: 'invalid-image-uri.jpg' }}
style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
/>
```
