# Expo Image Component: Unhelpful Error Messages on Image Load Failure

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue with the Expo `Image` component:  unhelpful error messages when images fail to load. The error messages often lack specifics, making debugging difficult.

## Problem
The `Image` component sometimes fails silently or provides vague error messages when it cannot load an image. This could be due to various reasons, including:

* Invalid or inaccessible image URIs.
* Network connectivity problems.
* Permissions issues.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling and checks. We should ensure that:

1. The image URI is correctly formatted and points to a valid resource.
2. The network is available.
3.  We handle potential errors gracefully.

This repository contains example code showcasing the problem and a solution using a custom error handling mechanism and fallback image.
